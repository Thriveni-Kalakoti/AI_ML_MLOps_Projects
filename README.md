# AI_ML_MLOps_Projects

This repository showcases my hands-on learning and practical implementation of end-to-end Machine Learning systems and MLOps practices. 

Unlike traditional notebook-based ML projects, this repository focuses on building production-style machine learning workflows — including model training, deployment, automation, CI/CD, and monitoring.

📁 Projects Included

| Project | Description | Tools/Tech |
|----------|------------|------------|

📌 Project Structure

Each project folder typically contains:

- README.md – Clear explanation of business problem, system design, and implementation
- src/ – Modular source code (data processing, model training, API code)
- tests/ – Basic unit tests for validation
- Dockerfile – Containerization setup (where applicable)
- .github/workflows/ – CI/CD pipeline configuration
- requirements.txt – Dependencies list

🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- FastAPI (Model Deployment)
- Docker (Containerization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- MLflow (Experiment Tracking – upcoming)
- OpenAI API / LLM frameworks (GenAI projects)
- Virtual Environments & Dependency Management

🎯 Learning Objectives

- Build production-ready ML systems instead of only notebooks
- Understand model lifecycle (training → validation → deployment)
- Implement CI/CD for ML workflows
- Deploy ML models as APIs
- Containerize ML applications using Docker
- Explore GenAI and LLM-based applications
- Practice clean architecture and modular design patterns

🚀 Getting Started

Each project can be cloned and run locally using Python 3.9+.

General setup steps:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AI_ML_MLOps_Projects
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Specific setup instructions are provided inside each project folder.

📌 Notes

These projects are designed to simulate real-world ML engineering workflows rather than only model experimentation.

The focus of this repository is to bridge the gap between Data Science and Production ML Systems, helping me transition toward ML Engineer, AI Engineer, and MLOps roles.

Projects will continuously evolve with better architecture, automation, and deployment strategies.
